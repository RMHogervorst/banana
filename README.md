# Banana üçå

<!-- badges: start -->

<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of banana is to measure everything in bananas. Using bananas to
measure things is on old meme that I still dearly love\[1\]. I still
sometimes take pictures with bananas for scale\!

But bananas are an interesting metric, and maybe show why the Brittish
and American people just can‚Äôt seem to let go of the feet: You are able
to intuitively understand how big a banana is.

A banana is a nice approximation when precision is just not that
important. And so in this package every banana vector has size bananas
and because I can‚Äôt imagine 1.23 banana, everything gets rounded up or
down to the nearest small or large banana.

First how to install it and than how to use it:

## Installation

You can install the released version of banana from
[CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
#install.packages("banana") # not on cran
devtools::install_github("RMHogervorst/banana")
```

## Examples üçå

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:
Turning ordinary sizes into banana approximations.

For instance I‚Äôm working on a macbook from early 2015 which is 13 inch
in diagonal, and according to a website the new models are 13.3 and 16
inches. As a european I don‚Äôt understand these sizes, but I do
understand bananas\!

``` r
library(banana)
library(units)
#> udunits system database from /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/3.6/Resources/library/units/share/udunits
```

``` r
# create unit size vector.
macbook <- set_units(c(13, 13.3, 16), "in")
macbook
#> Units: [in]
#> [1] 13.0 13.3 16.0
```

Let‚Äôs turn these non-intuitive inches (thumb size?) into something
recognizable: bananas\!

``` r
bananamac <- as_banana(macbook)
bananamac
#> <banana[3]>
#> [1] 2 small 2 small 2 large
```

The banana vector uses the {vctrs} package and tells us there are 3
items in this vector. Two are the size of 2 small bananas and one is the
size of 2 large bananas. Very clear what size that is\!

bananas are just like normal vectors: You can subset them.

``` r
bananamac[2:3]
#> <banana[2]>
#> [1] 2 small 2 large
```

Turn them into dataframes

``` r
data.frame(bananamac)
#>   bananamac
#> 1   2 small
#> 2   2 small
#> 3   2 large
```

Or look at their structure

``` r
str(bananamac)
#>  üçå [1:3] 2 small, 2 small, 2 large
```

The interesting thing I‚Äôm trying to create here is a vector that behaves
just like normal double vectors but displays in bananas.

The values are still there, in centimeter or in units (cm)

``` r
as.numeric(bananamac)
#> [1] 33.02 33.78 40.64
to_units(bananamac)
#> Units: [cm]
#> [1] 33.02 33.78 40.64
```

But the values are displayed as whole bananas.

The underlying values are still there though:

``` r
bananamac2 <- 1.23 * bananamac
bananamac2
#> <banana[3]>
#> [1] 2 large 2 large 2 large
```

The first element has not turned into 1.23 \* 2 = 2.46 small bananas,
but into 2 large bananas.

``` r
bananamac[[1]]
#> <banana[1]>
#> [1] 2 small
bananamac2[[1]]
#> <banana[1]>
#> [1] 2 large
```

Because only the print method is changed not the underlying data.

``` r
as.numeric(bananamac[[1]])
#> [1] 33.02
as.numeric(bananamac2[[1]])
#> [1] 40.61
```

Have fun with this package\!
